# Problem Statement:
Amazon US facilitates Indian sellers to sell their products in the US marketplace through their seller-fulfilled channels using a program called Amazon Global Selling. An Amazon seller in India is selling his books at Amazon's US marketplace.

The seller wants to create bulk listing excel files to be uploaded at Amazon seller portal. 
The inventory files are received in the form of excel/csv from the publisher or distributors on daily basis.

Using MS Excel it takes 40-45 minutes to preprocess each invetory file in order to create the required Product Listing File for a particular region. Along with performing the preprocessing steps, one of the major challenge to achieve the target selling price (SP) such that the seller wants a fixed amount of profit in this highly competative business environment.

The seller has neary 75,000 as inventory records from the multiple stackholders, if the seller seeks helps from Amazon.com or its service partners to create the Product Listing Files for such amount of inventory on their behalf, it will be charged nearly 75,000x3 = 225,000 INR for all three target countries The USA, Canada and Australia for each business day.

The seller wants to automate the whole process using Python in order to save both time and money.

## Challenges and other objectives:

* Using MS Excel it takes 40-45 minutes to preprocess the each invetory file in order to create the required Product Listing File for a particular region.
* Since Amazon fee is charged on selling price, using MS excel seller cannot achieved the target selling price for the desired amount of profit.


## Solution Provided:

* Reduced the processing time of each file from **40 minutes to 8 minutes**.
* Gradient descent type approach is used to achieve the target selling price for the desired amount of profit.
* Flask API is used to take the user inputs like daily currency exchange rate, target profit, target minimum profit.
